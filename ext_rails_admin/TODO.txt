--- Materialized Views ---
- 5 minutes interval aggregations with materialized views and dynamic table names
- table_name = table_name_<date> (ex.: table_name_20180201)
         columns = column_name_<operation> (ex.: voltage_average, temperature_average, etc.)
         operations = [count, average, minimum, maximum, sum]
